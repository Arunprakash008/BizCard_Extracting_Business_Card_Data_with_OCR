# BizCard_Extracting_Business_Card_Data_with_OCR

Optical Character Recognition, or OCR as it is commonly known, 
is a type of software that converts scanned images into structured data that is extractable, 
editable and searchable. When your records are digitized, scanning is only the first step.

It's important to note that while OCR is effective for extracting text from scanned documents and images, 
it primarily focuses on character recognition and doesn't possess the semantic understanding and 
versatility that Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers for data extraction from diverse sources.
